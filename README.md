# Solid Concept

When Applied properly it makes your code more extendable, logical and easier to read. When the developer builds a software following the bed design, the code can become inflexible and more brittle, small changes in thje software can result in bugs. For these reasons, we should follow SOLID Principles.

**S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)<br>
**O** - Open-Closed Principle (OCP)<br>
**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)<br>
**I** - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)<br>
**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)<br>

## **S** - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A Class should have only one reason to change. meaning that a class should have one job.
